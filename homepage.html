<h2><em>About Gates Ella</h2></em>


<p id="bio-container">
Hi, I’m <span class ="spread">Gates Ella</span>—gamer, coder-in-training, and unapologetic cat and rat enthusiast. Whether I’m deep into a storyline on my favorite console or watching my pets explore their tiny worlds, I find joy in the little things that bring life character and charm. My love for video games sparked a fascination with the creative and technical aspects behind them, which naturally led me to start learning how to code.


<p id="bio-container">
These days, I spend a lot of my time exploring the world of webpage design. I love how coding allows me to build something from scratch that’s not only functional but also beautiful and user-friendly. The challenge of learning new techniques and solving problems keeps me hooked, and I’m always chasing that “aha” moment when everything clicks into place. My projects are driven by curiosity, a desire to create, and a sprinkle of caffeine.


<p id="bio-container">
When I’m not immersed in code or gaming, you’ll probably find me at the library with a hot cup of coffee, soaking in the quiet and diving into books or new ideas. It’s my little sanctuary where inspiration flows freely and time slows down. Whether online or offline, I’m all about creativity, learning, and finding connection in unexpected places. Thanks for stopping by—I’m glad you’re here!
